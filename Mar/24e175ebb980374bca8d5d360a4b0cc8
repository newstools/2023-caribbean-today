CASTRIES, St. Lucia – An online Embarkation/Disembarkation (ED) form that allows for the electronic processing of travelers will be introduced here on Wednesday. The electronic ED Form will replace the written form, providing real-time information to Immigration, Customs, and Port Health, and will significantly reduce the processing time of arriving passengers. The system has been comprehensively tested at the George F.L. Charles Airport (SLU) and at the Hewanorra International Airport (UVF), with overwhelmingly positive feedback from the executing agencies, according to a statement issued on Monday. “We continuously strive to secure our borders and provide quality service to travelers at our points of entry while protecting the safety and security of our nationals, visitors, and business associates with a reliable immigration system. In advancing our seamless entry process, the written form will be phased out as of April 12, 2023,” said Assistant Superintendent in Charge of the Department of Immigration Sean Alexander. Completion of the online ED form is only applicable to air travel and is not a requirement for boarding; however, passengers should submit prior arrival in St. Lucia for swift processing on arrival. The introduction of the online ED form is delivered by the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Commission and funded through the 11th European Development Fund. It is also in line with initiatives by the government towards a digital conversion of public sector services, for the continued improvement of the island’s operational competencies and simplicity of conducting business.
