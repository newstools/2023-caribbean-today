NEW YORK CITY, New York – Devynne Charlton of the Bahamas and Jereem Richards Trinidad & Tobago were the only two athletes from the English-speaking Caribbean to grab wins at the Millrose Games indoor athletics meet on Saturday. Charlton continued her strong start to the athletics season with a win in the women’s 60 metres hurdles, and world indoor champion Richards avenged his loss last week to American Noah Williams in the men’s 400m. Charlton, 27, the only hurdler from North America in the race, clocked 7.91 seconds for her second successive win in the event, following her success last Saturday at the World Athletics Indoor Tour Gold meet in the American city of Boston. Tonea Marshall of the United States ran a season’s best time of 7.94 secs to finish 0.02 seconds ahead of her compatriot Sharika Nelvis, who edged Olympic sprint hurdles silver medallist and fellow American Nia Ali by one hundredth-of-a-second. Richards, 29, the Trinidad & Tobago Sport Personality-of-the-Year for 2022, ran a season’s best of 45.84 to beat American Noah Williams, who clocked 46.20, in the quarter mile. Only 0.004 seconds separated the pair last Saturday in Boston, and Richards may have felt reassured about his form after dismissing the challenge of Williams this time. Travis Williams of Jamaica finished second in a personal best time of 6.59 in the men’s 60m dash, which was won by world record-holder Christian Coleman of the United States in a season’s best of 6.47, with Josephus Lyles third in 6.593. Lyles’ elder brother, Noah was charged with a false start and ran the race under protest, clocking 6.53, but the time did not count. Lyles, the U.S. record-holder in the 200m outdoors, admitted a little bit of movement, but he said his feet never left the pad. Leah Anderson of Jamaica clocked 36.68 to finish third in the women’s 300 in which Abby Steiner claimed broke the U.S. record. Steiner, running only her second 300, held off a spirited challenge from compatriot Brittany Brown to finish in 35.54 and easily go under the five-year-old mark of 35.71 set by Quanera Hayes. Brown ran 36.13.
