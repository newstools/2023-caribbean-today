Recently, a big reveal took place at Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune Elementary School in Riviera Beach, FL as they celebrated a $50,000 Classroom Makeover, thanks to a generous grant from Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) and its charitable arm, the NextEra Energy Foundation. FPL has been recognized by the School District of Palm Beach County and the Florida Commissioner of Education for its critical role in supporting our schools and students. The school was able to purchase new state of the art 3-D glasses, chairs, cubbies and much more to enhance stem learning. Dozens of FPL employees volunteered at the ceremony with a special hands-on activity, as each class had the chance to build their own electric generator. FPL’s Classroom Makeover grants help give diverse students transformational learning opportunities… these grants are open to all grade levels at public, private and charter schools. Following the classroom unveiling, FPL employees held a generator build competition for the school’s 3rd – 5th grade students, allowing them firsthand experience in STEM with onsite mentoring and coaching. FPL is committed to helping make our communities even better places to live, work and raise a family – and a major part of that is investing in education.
