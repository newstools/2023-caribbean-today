CASTRIES, St. Lucia – The St. Lucia Bureau of Standards (SBS) is urging the public to be wary of the Fabuloso Multi-Purpose Cleaners after the manufacturer, Colgate-Palmolive, announced the recall of the product as it warned of the risk of exposure to bacteria. In a statement, the SBS said the recalled products may contain pseudomonas species bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas fluorescens, which are environmental organisms found widely in soil and water. “Colgate-Palmolive indicates that the correct amount of preservative was not added to the affected batches during the manufacturing process, leaving the bottles at risk of bacterial overgrowth. “People with weakened immune systems, external medical devices, or underlying lung conditions who are exposed to the bacteria face a risk of serious infection that may require medical treatment. The bacteria can enter the body if inhaled, through the eyes, or through a break in the skin. People with healthy immune systems are usually not affected by the bacteria,” the statement noted. The SBS said that the recall, conducted in cooperation with the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, encompasses 4.9 million bottles produced from December 14, 2022 through January 23, 2023, when the manufacturing issue was corrected. “Consumers who have purchased affected product should verify the lot numbers to determine if their product is part of affected Lot. Cease use of affected product. “Fabuloso Antibacterial multi-purpose cleaning products and select other variants of Fabuloso multi-purpose cleaning products are not included”. The statement said that if the product states “Made in Mexico” on the back label, it is not included in this recall.
