NEW YORK, NY - I was asked recently what is my favorite meat and I said chicken. Why? Because chicken is a very versatile meat – it can be grilled, fried, jerked, curried, stewed, baked, steamed. Chicken is also easy to prepare and can be eaten with various starches and vegetables. It’s economical, very nutritious and is a great source of protein. My favorite chicken dishes are curry chicken and jerk chicken!  Why curry chicken? Because it’s easy to make and can be eaten with dumplings, green bananas, soft yam, roasted breadfruit, Roti, white rice or rice and peas. I also love jerk chicken! It’s great as a snack or a meal! I love jerk chicken with freshly baked hard-dough bread or with rice and peas and dumplings! Today I will share with you my recipe for Jamaican Curry Chicken.
