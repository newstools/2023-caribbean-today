KINGSTON, Jamaica – Jamaica says its creative sector has generated approximately US$2.2 billion in earnings during 2022, accounting for 5.2 percent of the island’s gross domestic product (GDP). Culture, Gender, Entertainment and Sport Minister, Olivia Grange“Indeed, the United Nations has estimated that the Global Creative Industries generate in excess of two trillion US dollars in annual revenue and account for nearly 50 million direct and indirect jobs,” said Culture, Gender, Entertainment and Sport Minister, Olivia Grange. Speaking during the second staging of the Jamaica Creative Career Expo, organized by Jamaica Creative, in keeping with its mandate to facilitate and improve the engagement and development of creative stakeholders and public-private partnerships, Grange said the Ministry is looking to simulate the local sector’s continued exponential growth and that the Jamaica Creative Division was formed to represent all sectors within the entertainment, cultural and creative industries. “Jamaica Creative was established to have a council with representatives from the various ministries and from private sector [coming] together so [that] there is a coordinated joined-up approach to addressing the needs of the sector,” she said, adding that the body has, so far, produced a draft Cultural and Creative Industries Act, which will facilitate synergy throughout the sector. She said in addition, Jamaica Creative has facilitated practical learning opportunities for young and aspiring creatives through the provision of internships with companies and institutions in the sector. Grange also informed that a representative of the Division attended the recent 16th session of the Inter-Governmental Committee of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, from February 7 to 10, in Paris, France. “So, my Ministry is, therefore, operating at the local and international levels to ensure the development and growth of our creative sector and to ensure that opportunities are available for those who can earn, create jobs and make a significant contribution to the country’s gross domestic product based on their creative expressions and talent,” she said.
