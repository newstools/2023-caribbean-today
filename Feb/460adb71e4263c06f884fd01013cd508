The small Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis has big things going on in 2023. Tops on the calendar of events and activities this year is the popular St. Kitts Music Festival, to be held June 22-24, and kicking off what tourism officials have described as the “Summer of Fun”. The St. Kitts Tourism Authority reports St. Kitts and Nevis Restaurant Week, which is a celebration of the best cooking the islands have to offer, will be held between July 13 and 23. Special menus with fixed prices will feature sweet potato as the designated local ingredient. Towards the end of summer, Caribbean Premier League (CPL) 2023 cricket will be played at Warner Park, St. Kitts, while the Nevis to St. Kitts Cross Channel Swim will take place next month. Now in its 21st year, what started as a simple memorial has blossomed into one of the Caribbean’s favorite open water swimming events. World-class athletes will rub shoulders with recreational swimmers on March 26. “This year’s exciting calendar of events is reflective of the many shining qualities and distinctions of our St. Kitts: our people, music, culinary, rum, art and culture. We are thrilled to share Kittitian culture authentically with our travellers throughout the year, especially during our ‘Summer of Fun’,” said Ellison “Tommy” Thompson, CEO of the St. Kitts Tourism Authority. Sugar Mas, St. Kitts-Nevis National Carnival, features six weeks of fêtes, calypso, waterworks, live events and fun over the Christmas and New Year holiday season. This month, St. Kitts launched its newest island offering, the Kittitian RumMaster. Led by two of St. Kitts’ prestigious rum experts, the Kittitian RumMaster program invites travelers to dig deeper into the history and production of rum, and gain hands-on experience creating tasty beverages.
