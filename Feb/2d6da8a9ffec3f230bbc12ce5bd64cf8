HAVANA, Cuba – The government of Cuba says that 61 years after the signing of Proclamation 3447, which established the imposition of an economic, commercial and financial blockade by the United States on Cuba, the system is the most severe, prolonged and inhumane applied against any nation.

Kennedy, and pointed out that for more than 60 years Cuban’s have faced unjust aggression. According to official figures, the accumulated damages during six decades of application of this policy amount to more than US$154.2 billion , and taking into account the behavior of the dollar against the value of gold in the international market, the quantifiable damages reach US$ 391.1 billion dollars. Rodriguez Parrilla has denounced on several occasions that the U.S. blockade was carefully designed, targeting each one of Cuba’s main sources of income, viciously seeking to increase the impact on the daily life of the population. According to Cuban authorities, the siege has tightened in recent years to unprecedented levels, and an example of this is that only between August 2021 and February 2022, the island recorded losses of 3,806.5 billion dollars, a figure 49 % higher than that reported in the period January-July 2021. According to the Cuban government, the US persists in ignoring this result and has tightened the blockade to unprecedented levels, applying a policy of economic choking to deliberately seek the collapse of the country.
