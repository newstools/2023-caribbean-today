TORTOLA, British Virgin Islands – The Premier of the British Virgin Islands, Dr. Natalio Wheatley, has dismissed rumors that his administration could be moving towards hold early general elections. Dr Natalio WheatleyGeneral elections are constitutionally due by mid-May, but it has been widely slugged that polls could be held as early as March. With the House of Assembly (HOA) prorogued weeks ago to end the Fourth Session of the Fourth HOA, questions have been raised as to why the HOA was not dissolved instead to facilitate the holding of elections. But  Wheatley addressed those concerns  when questioned by reporters during  a recent press conference. “The first meeting of the House of Assembly in 2019 was in March, I think March 12, so the House has to dissolve by March 12,” said Premier Wheatley whose reference to 2019 highlighted the last general elections. “We are not going to have early elections.” Premier Wheatley further explained that in the framework agreement for the implementation of the Commission of Inquiry recommendations, his government committed to completing a full four-year term. The Premier also confirmed that he intends to lead his Virgin Islands Party into the elections as head of the slate.
