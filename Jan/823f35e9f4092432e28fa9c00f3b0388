The prize includes a five-night stay for two at Stonefield Villa Resort, including flights to Saint Lucia. “A visit to Saint Lucia means meeting our people and immersing in our culture," remarked Lorine Charles-St. Jules, CEO of the Saint Lucia Tourism Authority. “There are so many ways to do this, and we would love to see more visitors experience the Nobel Laureate Festival each year. It’s an opportunity to see more of the island, get out into the communities and revel in our heritage. It could be art, poetry, history tours, or even rum. There's so much to enjoy. Our prestigious Nobel Laureates have contributed to Saint Lucian history and culture for generations, and we are proud to continue celebrating their global recognition with our visitors and residents.”
