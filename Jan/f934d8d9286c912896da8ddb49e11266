It means it has some work to be done in getting back to our pre-pandemic numbers, but still an excellent accomplishment,” she said. “It also meant we would have surpassed our 2022 target of just over 50,000 arrivals. We also saw in 2022 that October was the highest as it pertains to arrivals to the island and that can be attributed to the excellent work of the World Music Festival,” that had been suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years. She said with the relaxed protocols for entry into the island as well as the work of the various stakeholders would have contributed to the increased arrivals during October as well as December.
