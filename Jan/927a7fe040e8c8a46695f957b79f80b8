Miami, FL - The Univisión network has announced the official list of nominees for the annual Premio lo Nuestro gala, and the undisputed queen of the tropical genre, Olga Tañón, is nominated in two categories once again, being the Artist with the most Lo Nuestro Awards in history. Without a doubt, the Premio Lo Nuestro ceremony is very special for Olga Tañón, as it was the one that last year marked her musical rebirth, in which she made her premise "I'M BACK" very clear, and in which she not only participated as a nominee, but also took the stage with his urban colleagues Jon Z and Jay Wheeler. Since then, "La Tañón" hasn't stopped releasing new music or surprising her devoted fans. This year, "la mujer de fuego" is nominated in two categories: Artist of the Year-Tropical (only female in this category) and Album of the Year-Tropical for her most recent record production "Tañón Pal' Combo es lo que Hay,". "A year ago, I promised myself to be the best version of myself and every day I feel the commitment to overcome each project, each song, each initiative, because I owe so much to my audience that they deserve nothing less than the best, thank you for this", commented Olga Tañón. Olga Tañón had a successful 2022, with 12 new musical releases, sold-out concerts, and over 10 million monthly Spotify listeners.
