HALLANDALE BEACH, Florida â€“ Jamaican jockey Shaun Bridgmohan earned success in the US$75 000 Sunshine Turf Stakes when he took 7-1 choice Roaring Forties gate-to-wire to win the feature at Gulfstream Park here Saturday. Jockey Shaun Bridgmohan.The pair out-paced favorite Max K.O at the break to settle in front for the mile and sixteenth trip, before holding off the fast-finishing 3-1 bet Hot Blooded to win by half-length in a time of one minute, 40.57 seconds. For the seven-year-old chestnut gelding, the victory was his first added-money success, after making his 23 previous starts all at Woodbine racetrack in Toronto, Canada. The 43-year-old Bridgmohan, who is also based at Woodbine, broke Roaring Forties from the outside post and hustled him to the front to chisel out fractions of 23.10 seconds for the quarter mile and 47.69 for the half. Max K.O, trained by Barbadian trainer Saffie Joseph Jr, chased from second while Hot Blooded and Lure Him In tracked from the middle of the six-horse field. Coming off the final turn, Max K.O made his move on the outside, pulling up next to Roaring Forties to spark a duel at the top of the lane. However, Roaring Forties accelerated along the rails to re-establish his two length on the field as Max K.O faded. Junior Alvarado then brought Hot Blooded with a charging run down the middle of the track but just missed out.
